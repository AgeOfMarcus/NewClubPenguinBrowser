# FlashBrowser2
A small browser capable of viewing/displaying pages with embedded flash content.

#How do I use it?
Right now, I haven't packaged any of the programs and made any official releases. So, just simply download the respository and run npm install in the directory. Then, to run it,
run npm start and the browser should open.

#Future Plans?
I plan to implement the capability of importing .swf files to run them as well as packaging the files so that they may be run more easily on all devices.
